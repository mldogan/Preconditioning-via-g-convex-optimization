This is our repository for experiments on using geodesically convex optimization for preconditioning.
We use the wonderful manopt package.  
Currently, the experiements are performed on block diagonal matrices with three options: left, right, and left+right block diagonal group action.
Here is a plot from left-diagonal preconditioning with 5x5 blocks :)

The repo is meant to be a companion to our paper (in preparation) where we develop the necessary theory and introduce needed concepts from Lie groups and convexity.
